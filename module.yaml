description: |
    Computes the Compton-y Sunyaev-Zeldovich observable for galaxy clusters,
    based on a halo pressure profile.
    The output is a grid of the Compton-y profile of a galaxy cluster at an
    angle theta from the cluster center, for a halo of a given mass and
    redshift. The 1-halo and 2-halo contributions are computed separately,
    yielding two separate 3d arrays. See belows for details on the output
    format.

    To run, you should need CAMB, sigma_r, mf_tinker before cluster-sz in
    your CosmoSIS pipeline. Additionally, you will need a module to compute
    the Tinker halo bias, the expected output of which is described below.

params:
    profiletype: One-halo pressure profile model. Currently only "Battaglia" (https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ApJ...758...75B/abstract) is supported
    verbose: Whether to print progress updates. Boolean, default True.
    thetas: Array of angular bins at which to compute Compton-y profile, in arcmin.
    sigma_psf: The standard deviation of the Gaussian point spread function, in arcmin.
    Mmin: Float. The minimum halo mass, M_{200m} in M_{sun}.
    Mmax: Float. The maximum halo mass, M_{200m} in M_{sun}.
    nM: Int. The number of halo masses at which to compute Compton-y profiles. Optional, default 20.
    zmin: Float. The minimum redshift.
